---

Term sheets is a javascript app to produce terminal typing and output animations for embedding in presentations, readmes, tweets, etc. Other solutions usually involve recording a live screen. I wanted a way to simply provide a payload of instructions so I didn't have to reherse my typing and wait for network output, as well as style it to look nice.

### Example:

<p align="center">
  <img width="700" height="440" src="https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/image/2018/7/6/a48abe57-bd33-45a9-b7d0-2cad3ff97078-term-sheet-1530897650711.svg">
</p>

### Goals:

1.  Client-side only
2.  Exported term-sheets should be pure markup/css
3.  SVG exports should remain portable/strict so they can be embedded in github readmes
