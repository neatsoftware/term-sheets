# Term Sheets

Create animated terminal presentations. Export as SVG, animated GIF, or HTML+CSS.

---

Term sheets is a JavaScript app to produce terminal typing and output animations for embedding in presentations, readmes, tweets, etc. Other solutions usually involve recording a live screen. I wanted a way to simply provide a payload of instructions so I didn't have to rehearse my typing and wait for network output, as well as style it to look nice.

### Example:

<p align="center">
  <img width="700" height="440" src="https://rawgit.com/gpoitch/term-sheets/master/example.svg">
</p>

### Goals:

1.  Client-side only
2.  Exported term-sheets should be pure markup/CSS
3.  SVG exports should remain portable/strict so they can be embedded in GitHub readmes
