# Term Sheets

Create animated terminal presentations. Export as SVG, animated GIF, or HTML+CSS.

Term sheets is a JavaScript app to produce terminal typing and output animations for embedding in presentations, readmes, tweets, etc. Other solutions usually involve recording a live screen. I wanted a way to simply provide a payload of instructions so I didn't have to rehearse my typing and wait for network output, as well as style it to look nice.

### Example:

  <a href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/neatsoftware/term-sheets@09b20859c30fdc98bd5f3b1b6cd9eff9de0ba8d8/example.svg"><img width="700" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/neatsoftware/term-sheets@09b20859c30fdc98bd5f3b1b6cd9eff9de0ba8d8/example.svg"></a>

### Goals:

1.  Client-side only
2.  Exported term-sheets should be pure markup/CSS
3.  SVG exports should remain portable/strict so they can be embedded in GitHub readmes
